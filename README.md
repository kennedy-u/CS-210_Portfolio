CS-210 Projects

## [Project 1 - Clock App](Project%201%20-%20Clock%20App)
A 12 and 24-hour console clock app written in C++.

Display 12-hour clock format where the clock does not exceed 12:59:59, display 24-hour clock format where the clock does not exceed 23:59:59,
and both clocks will synchronously  display the host current time in a proper format.

## [Project 2 - Investment Banking App](Project%202%20-%20Investment%20Banking%20App)
Investment/compound interest console app written in C++.

An application that allows users to see how their investment will grow over time.
A screen that takes initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest (compound) and number of years.

A screen that displays two static reports. One for year-end balances and year-end earned interest if no additional monthly deposits are made. The second displays the year-end balances and year-end earned interest based on the monthly deposit value that was input by the yser ($50.00 in this example). See below

## [Project 3 - Inventory Tracking App](Project%203%20-%20Inventory%20%20Tracking%20App)
Inventory tracker console app written in C++ and Python.

Reads in a given text-based file that conatains a list of purchased items for a single day, with the item being listed each time it is sold. The app will produce a list of all items sold in a given day along with the number of times each item was sold. It will display a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day and produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased. See below

[Project 3 Programming Languages Explanation](docs/Project%203%20Programming%20Language%20Explanation.pdf)

## What I did particularly well in project 3.
Integrated interface that incorporates all the necessary elements. Specifically, I designed a calculator that computes both monthly interest and the annual interest rate, which is then divided by 12. In this repo, youâ€™ll find the code to calculate the interest earned over a given number of years.

## Challanges I faced when writing the code and how I overcome them.
During the development and integration of my sources, I encountered minimal roadblocks. However, I faced some roadblocks when I was designing the .h header file(s). It was nearly my first time including a header files in a C++ program. To make things easier I requested assistance from the academic support service where I learned everything about header files.

Here are things I learned during that process.

Header File Purpose: Header files (.h) serve as declarations for classes, functions, and variables. They provide an interface for other parts of the program.
Separation of declaration and definition are standard practice in C++, you can declare classes and their methods in the header file and later define them later in the source code (.cpp files).

## Skills I learned from this project that are tranferable to other projects or course work.
Skills I learned from this projects include how to declare functions properly, do some calculations and logic that are required during the development of a project source code. Throughout this course I deeply learned how to integrate C++ and Python!!!! It took me some time to fully digest how these processes work. Now I can easily refer to the file path and do my configuration how I want it or as required.
Thanks for reading :)
